# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a simple web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project marks my first venture into web development, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Responsive design: Play the game on various devices, thanks to a responsive layout.
- Score tracking: Keep track of the scores for both X and O as you play.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

- Click on a cell to make your move.
- The game alternates between X and O.
